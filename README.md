## Generating new DCO stats

The exec directory is used when there's an executive committee meeting.
Can create other directories for other meetings, like the portal group
meetings, reports, etc...

```
% findnew.sh work_dir

For example

% findnew.sh `pwd`

% findnew.sh /opt/dco/dco-viz/dco-stats/exec
```
