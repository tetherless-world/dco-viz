The solubility of carbon in magmas is very low; most magmas have low carbon concentrations by the time they erupt to the surface. This has made it difficult to constrain the carbon content of the mantle where these magmas are sourced. We are studying the concentrations of carbon and other volatiles in a suite of well characterized mid-ocean ridge basaltic glass samples in order to assess (1) the carbon content of seafloor glass on a global scale and (2) the carbon content of mid-ocean ridge source mantle.
